# Applications of Machine Learning in Biological Systems

### Overview

This repository contains small projects aimed at exploring the applications of various machine learning models and techniques in biological contexts. Each project tackles a different problem related to health and biological systems, where machine learning is used to derive insights, make predictions, or classify risks.

### Contents

The repository is organized into the following projects:

	•	Project 1: Medical Insurance Expense Prediction
Objective: Estimate individual medical insurance expenses based on factors such as age, BMI, smoking status, and other health-related variables.
Techniques Used: Linear Regression, Data Preprocessing, Feature Engineering.
	•	Project 2: Coronary Heart Disease Risk Prediction
Objective: Perform binary classification on a dataset to predict the 10-year risk of coronary heart disease.
Techniques Used: Logistic Regression, Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix).
	•	Project 3: Decision Tree for Classifying Biological Data
Objective: Train a decision tree to classify biological data (e.g., determining the viability of cells). Fit the data to the decision tree model and plot validation loss and accuracy while varying the epoch (iteration) value from 1 to 20.
Techniques Used: Decision Tree, Model Validation, Plotting Learning Curves.

### Key Areas of Focus:

	•	Supervised Learning: Applying models like logistic regression, linear regression, and decision trees to biological datasets.
	•	Data Preprocessing: Handling missing data, feature selection, and data transformations for health-related variables.
	•	Model Evaluation: Accuracy, confusion matrix, validation loss, and accuracy plots for assessing model performance.
	•	Feature Importance: Evaluating which variables have the highest influence on predictions like medical costs or disease risk.
