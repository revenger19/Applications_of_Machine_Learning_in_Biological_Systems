# Project Execution Guide

## Overview
This guide provides instructions on how to execute the Jupyter Notebook for training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on image data, focused on classifying images as malignant or benign. The project includes data preparation, model setup, training, and making predictions.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Necessary Python libraries: TensorFlow, NumPy, Matplotlib, etc. (install manually as needed)

## Setup
1. **Clone the repository or download the project files** to your local machine.
2. **Install Required Libraries**: Install the required Python libraries. Since there is no `requirements.txt`, you will need to install the dependencies manually:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
   ```
3. **Dataset Preparation**:
   - Ensure you have the dataset in a folder named `Dataset2` structured as follows:
     ```
     Dataset2/
     ├── FNA/
     │   ├── benign/
     │   └── malignant/
     └── test/
     ```

## Running the Notebook
### Locally
1. **Open the Notebook**: Open `Project5.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. **Define Paths**: Update the data paths in the notebook to point to the location where your dataset `Dataset2` is stored.
3. **Follow the Execution Steps**: Run the cells in sequence from data augmentation to predictions.

### Using Google Colab
1. **Upload the Notebook to Google Colab**: Go to Google Colab and upload `Project5.ipynb`.
2. **Mount Google Drive** (Optional): If your data is stored in Google Drive, follow the instructions in the notebook to mount your Google Drive.
3. **Define Paths**: Update the data paths in the notebook to point to the location where your datasets are stored in Google Drive.
4. **Follow the Execution Steps**: Execute the notebook cells in sequence from data augmentation to predictions.

## Additional Notes
- Adjust hyperparameters and paths according to your specific needs and environment setup.
- For best performance, especially during model training, ensure that your machine has adequate resources or use a GPU in Google Colab.

## Support
For any issues or further assistance, contact the project maintainer or submit an issue in the project repository.
